        <h2>Sumo Bot Design</h2>
    </header>
    <p>The project aimed to build a sumo bot for an Undergraduate class focusing on learning Electronic and Mechanical Systems (EMS) 
        design from the ground up. The challenge was to construct a functioning robot and gain hands-on experience in designing PCB boards, 
        coding, and robotics. Inspired by a desire to delve deeper into robotics, 
        this endeavor was a foundational step toward pursuing further education.</p>

    <p>The sumo bot was designed from the ground up, including a custom-built PCB board and carefully sourced components. 
        The robot, powered by code written in C++ and ran on a Nucleo, featured opponent detection sensors and line detection capabilities to 
        enable autonomous operation and competition. With a 3D-printed body and four-wheel drive, the robot was engineered to be agile and durable. 
        Bluetooth functionality was integrated to allow wireless control, 
        highlighting a commitment to incorporating advanced features despite the project's DIY nature.</p>

    <p>The robot's performance was tested in a competitive setting, where its primary objective was to remain within a designated circle while confronting opponents. 
        The project presented unique challenges as a solo team, particularly in achieving reliable performance against teams with more resources. Despite these obstacles, 
        the robot was functional enough to compete and could hang in the ring with the other team's robots. The experience was invaluable, offering real-world insights into the 
        complexities of hardware-software integration and the importance of precision in sensor readings and communication rates.</p>

    <p>Although the robot didnâ€™t end with all my initially planned features and faced difficulties in competition, the project was a significant learning journey. 
        It ultimately inspired me to pursue a career and education in Robotics. The challenges encountered, 
        especially in hardware interfacing and obtaining accurate sensor data, 
        were pivotal in highlighting areas for improvement. Time permitting, this summer, I plan to revisit the project 
        and rebuild some systems with the new things I have learned to see if I could make a more effective robot.</p>
